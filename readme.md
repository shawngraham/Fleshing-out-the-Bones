### mea culpa

I created this repository whilst unaware of the large file size limit that Github imposes. Thus, the image vectors zip file is not part of this repository. In the paper itself I instead use and cite the Open Science Framework repos, and you may find the code and the image vectors zip file [DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/9CFJA](https://osf.io/9cfja/). 

Apologies.
